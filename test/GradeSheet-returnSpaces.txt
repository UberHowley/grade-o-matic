Grade: B+ 

Comments from Graders:

- Make sure to put at least a couple comments in the code to describe
the trickier parts. For instance, the following might be helpful to somebody
reading the code for utc_day:
  remainder = (days + 4) % 7  # we add 4 because Jan 1, 1970 is a Thursday
We ask students to do this in order to develop the habit of commenting 
less self-explanatory lines of code.
- Observe that the lab description states "To help it compute the current day of
the week, `local_day` should call the function `utc_day`." Code that re-uses
existing functions is generally shorter, easier to maintain, and easier to
understand.
