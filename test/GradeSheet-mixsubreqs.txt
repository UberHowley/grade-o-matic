GRADE SHEET FOR CS1 LAB ("Retroshop"):
     
Requirements of this lab:
   ~ Correctly implements the function flip_horizontal
   + Correctly implements the function flip_vertical
   +/~ Correctly implements the function invert
   + Correctly implements the function transform_image 
   ~ Correctly implements the green_screen function     
   1. day_of_week(day)
     + Computes correctly
     + Makes appropriate use of conditionals 
   +/~ Comments are appropriately used to explain hard-to-follow logic
   + Passes our tests

Grade:   D


Comments from Graders:
- In flip_horizontal, the first line of code is unnecessary since image1
   does not get used again.
+ Nice job with the one line flip_vertical()!
- In invert(), 255 is already an integer so it is unnecessary to "assign an
   integer type" to it. Variable "pixel" is also unnecessary; [pixel - y] in
   line 70 can directly be written as [255 - y].
- In green_screen, note that instructions say to create a new image. Though
   a new variable img5 is created, img5 points to the same lists as foreground
   such that changing img5 also changes foreground.
- Use clearer variable names that better reflect what is going on in the
   code, e.g. "x" and "y" are too generic, "img4" in invert does not actually
   refer to an image but rather a row in an image.
~ Too many comments also makes code difficult to navigate/read! Try to just
   get at the bare minimum of functionality/explanation.
