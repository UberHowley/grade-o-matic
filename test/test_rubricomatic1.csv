Major
----;;Returns negative values for UTCDay
--;;Doesn’t call UTCDay - why write a function if you don't use it?
--;;dayOfWeek doesn’t return all days of the week
++;;Great job!
Minor
-;; Good start, but some minor issues: 
-;;Don't use pre-calculated constants for arithmetic without explaining where they came from
-;;Many of your numerical conversions are inefficient
-;;localDay should not cast to an int
Observations
~;;dayOfWeek should always return something
~;;simplifying Thurs -> Sun adjustment (used if/else)
~;;You've imported some modules you don't need, might want to review your VSCode preferences	
Other
-;;If you write a function, you should use it (i.e., UTCDay)! 
-;;Due to subtracting 3 after %7, you're going to get negative days, which will be a problem. See "TestResults.txt"
-;;Good start, but some issues related to repetitive code & negative days 
-;;An else block could catch unexpected input and print an error message for debugging that can be helpful!
Commenting
--;;No added comments
~;;Remember to update the Collaboration Line in the README.
~;;Too much comments also makes code difficult to navigate/read! Try to just get at the Bare minimum of functionality/explanation.
~;;Small note: comments only have to be one/two lines long and not necessarily complete sentences.
