Mostly good (17 A … 4 A- … 1 B+ … 1 B- … 1 E).

This is the summary of my final “rubric”:
Major:
		returns negative values for UTCDay (major x2)
		doesn’t call UTCDay
		no added comments
		dayOfWeek doesn’t return all days of the week
Minor:
		uses pre-calculated constants for arithmetic without explaining where they came from
		inefficient conversions
		casts to int in localDay
Comment:
		dayOfWeek should always return something
		simplifying Thurs → Sun adjustment (used if/else)
		funky imports
		
Good start, but some issues related to repetitive code: 
if you write a function, you should use it (i.e., UTCDay)! 

Good start, but due to subtracting 3 after %7, you're going to get negative
days, which will be a problem. See "TestResults.txt"

Remember to update the Collaboration Line in the README.

Small note: comments only have to be one/two lines long and not necessarily complete sentences.
Too much comments also makes code difficult to navigate/read! Try to just get at the
Bare minimum of functionality/explanation.
