GRADE SHEET FOR CS1 LAB ("Retroshop"):
     
Requirements of this lab:
   + Correctly implements the function flip_horizontal
   + Correctly implements the function flip_vertical
   + Correctly implements the function invert
   + Correctly implements the function transform_image 
   + Correctly implements the green_screen function     
   ~ Code makes good use of variable names, and is clear and readable
   - Comments are appropriately used to explain hard-to-follow logic
   + Passes our tests

Grade:   A-


Comments from Graders: Good job! Code passes all tests
* general
   ~ the list comprehensions used to initialize the new_images are a complex
   technique that have not been taught in this class - it's a good idea to
   demonstrate a solid understanding of the concepts that have been presented 
   in class rather than using other approaches that have not yet been covered
   - docstrings (inside the """/""") should not be removed and should always be 
   sandwiched between the function header and the code
   ~ add brief, succinct comments preceding each logical block of code; these are
   denoted with the # sign
         `
         def flip_horizontal(image):
            new_image = []
            for row in image:
               new_image = new_image + [row[::-1]]
            return new_image
         
         def flip_vertical(image):
            return image[::-1]
`

   ~ In python there are two approaches to for loops --> 
      (1) use range and iterate over indices (which is necessary in green_screen
         because knowing the index makes it possible to loop through two images
         simultaneously)
      (2) directly iterate over the elements if index location is not relevant 
         * this is the more efficient approach for all the other retroshop functions
         and would eliminate the need for the for loop that initializes each
         element in the new_image with empty lists
* flip_horizontal & flip_vertical
   ~ fewer loops are needed if list slicing is used
