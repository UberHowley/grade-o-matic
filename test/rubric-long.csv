----;;Returns negative values for UTCDay
--;;Doesn’t call UTCDay - why write a function if you don't use it?
--;;dayOfWeek doesn’t return all days of the week
++;;Great job!
-;;Don't use pre-calculated constants for arithmetic without explaining where they came from
-;;Many of your numerical conversions are inefficient
-;;localDay should not cast to an int
Observations
~;;simplifying Thurs -> Sun adjustment (used if/else)
Other
-;;"Due to subtracting 3 after %7, you're going to get negative days, which will be a problem. See ""TestResults.txt"""
-;;An else block could catch unexpected input and print an error message for debugging that can be helpful!
--;;No added comments
~;;Too much comments also makes code difficult to navigate/read! Try to just get at the Bare minimum of functionality/explanation.
;;adding one
