++;;Great job passing all the autotests!
+;;Nice use of in-line comments!
--;;In-line comments are required for more complex code.
-;;Added an attribute that's not needed (like self.corpus). Why store this?
~;;It's often best to use the getter/accessor method within the class, rather than accessing the attributes directly.
-;;Protected attributes that start with an underscore should not be accessed from outside of the class!
-;;Single characters are not meaningful variable names. Use more descriptive names.
FreqWord
~;FreqWord._init_();Do not need to cast count to an int, as it should already be passed to the method as an integer (see docstring).
--;FreqWord.has_prefix();The suggested str.startswith(..) method is significantly more efficient than 'in', and also more accurate - only want to check the beginning!
--;FreqWord.matches_pattern();Fails the autotest here because you need to check length is the same, or else they don't match!
-;FreqWord.matches_pattern();Matching could be simplified: Single loop where you check if 2 characters are equal, or if pattern is a wildcard character.
~;FreqWord._str_();using the str.format(..) method could also work nicely here, instead of concatenation!
AutoComplete
-;AutoComplete._init_();Count should be cast to an int before being passed to FreqWord initializer.
~;AutoComplete._init_();It's better to exit the 'with open() as' block as soon as you're done with the file, meaning it's slightly preferred to have the return statement outside of the 'with' block.
-;AutoComplete._match_words();Matching could be simplified: Single loop
   where you use matches_pattern if '.' in criteria, and has_prefix otherwise.
-;AutoComplete.suggest_comp();Don't need to check that length of new_list > 3 in order to slice!
~;AutoComplete._str_();A list comprehension could make the converting to a string version a little more succinct.
~;AutoComplete._str_();Using '\n'.join(lst) could be more succinct for combining the list of strings into a single string and would also avoid the extra newline at the end that is causing a failed autotest.
+;AutoComplete._str_();Nice use of list comprehension!
Result
~;Result._str_();Using '|'.join([]) string method would  avoid the error that shows in TestResults.txt, so you wouldn't have to handle a word without results specially.
+;Result._str_();Nice use of str.join! A list comprehension could make converting the items to a list of str more succinct.
