Major
++;;    Great job on this non-trivial CS1 lab!
+;;     Good variable names throughout.
+;;     Nice job with the one line flip_vertical()!
+;;     green_screen() is nice and succinct.
Minor
-;;     The code could be a lot more efficient with fewer loops.
-;;     flip_vertical(): Sequences do not need to be manually reversed. [::-1] will do that.
-;;     transform_img: an if isn't needed to determine which function to apply: iterate over transforms
Observations
~;;     Meaningful, descriptive variable names would make code much easier to read/debug
~;;     range() is really only needed in greenscreen, where you need the pixel locations. All other functions can iterate directly over the elements.
~;;     flip_vertical() can be just one line
~;;     flip_horizontal(): the 2 lines in the loop body can be converted to one.
~;;     greenscreen(): The default start index for range() is 0. No need to explicitly state it.
Commenting
--;;     Comments are needed for more complex chunks of code.
~;;     Too many comments also makes code difficult to navigate/read! Try to just get at the bare minimum of functionality/explanation.
~;;     On commenting: if an in-line comments goes off the screen, place it _above_ the code its commenting, and if it's still long, give it a second line
~;;     Do not remove the docstrings (comments between the ''' ...''') at the top of functions: they're VERY useful!
-;;     Unnecessary print() statements should be removed before submitting the assignment
