Observations
+;goodbye.py;Great descriptive variable names!
+;goodbye.py;Nice job exploring arithmetic operations
~;;Variable names should be descriptive (sum, if calculating sum, etc.)
~;; In the future, your return (and print) statements will need to match the capitalization, type, etc. as what's specified in the lab document.
+;goodbye.py; Good job having your print statement correctly describe the operator
~;goodbye.py; Print statement should correctly describe the operation (sum: +, product: *) 
~;; Readability would be increased by having blank lines around code chunks
~;;Readability would be increased if you don't have text running off the side of the window (this is very true for comments going forward!)
