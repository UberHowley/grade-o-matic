~;;Accumulation does not happen in variables so much in recursion as it does in the return statements. No need to declare an accumulator variable at top of function.
sum_digits()
--;digits();Base case should catch when num is less than 10, then return that num!
--;digits();Don't convert the num to a str. Use // and % arithmetic instead.
--;digits();Needs to return the sum of the digits.
~;digits();Code could have one fewer recursive call if base case is for one digit number & return num, rather than 0.
bedtime_story()
--;bedtime();Base case should check that there's fewer than 2 characters and return empty list.
-;bedtime();Second base case of 2 characters isn't needed.
--;bedtime();Needs to return a list of strings representing the story.
nested_squares()
-;squares();Function should be invariant, return it to where it started!
--;squares();Base case should check that size < gap*2, don't draw anything & return 0.
--;squares();Needs to return the number squares drawn, one per function frame!
-;squares();While function would draw correctly without being invariant, the lab doc asked that turtle return to where it started! This explains the TestResults error.
draw_quilt()
-;quilt();Function should be invariant, return it to where it started!
--;quilt();Base case should check that quilt is less than patch_size, draw last square & return 1.
--;quilt();Needs to return number squares drawn, 2 per function frame, plus whatever the recursive calls draw!
~;quilt();quilt_size//2 used often enough, it could be a good variable.
-;quilt(); Need to draw quilt as quadrants (2 separate small squares + 2 nested quilts), not one big square! (Otherwise, why add 2 to the return count?)
shrub()
+;shrub();Good job making this one invariant!
-;shrub();Function should be invariant, return it to where it started!
--;shrub();Base case should check that branch is less than min, and return 0.
--;shrub();Need to return _length_ of branches drawn, one per function frame!
~;testq4_shrub_test2();This stems from a <= instead of a < base case condition. Not an issue.
